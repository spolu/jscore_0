# JSCore₀

Annotated TypeScript to Lean 4 proofs. Agents write code and proofs, humans review annotations, the Lean kernel checks everything.

```
annotated .ts  -->  extractor (ts-morph)  -->  Lean 4 AST + theorems  -->  lake build  -->  verified
```

## Motivation

The bottleneck has shifted. Models are increasingly capable. The deficiency is now human:

- **Humans can't write formal specifications** from scratch, but they can approve a one-line constraint
- **Humans can't review agent-generated code** at the scale and speed agents produce it
- **Humans can't catch subtle behavioral regressions** across thousands of lines of changed implementation

JSCore₀ inverts the usual flow: agents write code, proofs, and most invariants. Humans only specify what the code should do by collaborating with agents on annotations, and a mathematical kernel checks the proofs. The human's role is authoring intent and approving behavioral changes, not reading implementation.

All proofs in `examples/` were generated entirely by coding agents (Claude). No human wrote Lean. Developers don't need to know anything about formal methods, Lean, or proof theory. They write TypeScript. The agent proposes annotations and proves them. The human reviews annotations, challenges them informally ("what about the case where..."), and iterates with the agent until the spec is right. The annotations follow a small formal grammar but are designed to be readable without training.

This is a proof of concept. Taint and nonexistence proofs close instantly (`native_decide`), but runtime property proofs can take a coding agent up to an hour of iteration against the Lean kernel. Not practical yet, but the trajectory is clear: as models get better at Lean, the loop tightens. This project exists to demonstrate that the approach works end-to-end today, and that formal verification can apply to normal codebases without any formal methods expertise.

## The three annotations

Agents collaborate with humans on three types of comment annotations. `@requires` and `@invariant` go on function signatures; `@ensures` goes inline at call sites in the function body.

```typescript
// @requires amount > 0
// @requires fromId ≠ toId
// @invariant ws-isolation: ∀ call db.* (c) => c.where.workspaceId = auth.workspaceId
// @invariant conservation: ∀ call db.account.update (u) =>
//   sum(u.data.balance.increment) = 0
async function transferCredits(
  auth: Auth,
  fromId: string,
  toId: string,
  amount: number,
) {
  const from = await db.account.findUnique({ where: { id: fromId } });
  // @ensures from.balance ≥ amount

  // ... implementation
}
```

**`@requires`** - a precondition the caller must satisfy. Becomes a hypothesis in the proof. Not about where the check happens, but who is responsible.

**`@invariant`** - a property proved over every execution of the function. The tag (`ws-isolation`, `conservation`) is a human-readable name for CI output and review diffs.

```typescript
// @invariant ws-isolation: ∀ call db.* (c) =>
//   c.where.workspaceId = auth.workspaceId

// @invariant no-secret-leak: ¬ tainted apiKey in call logger.*

// @invariant auth-gate: ∀ call db.*.update (u) =>
//   ∃ call permissions.check (p) before u where p.action = "write"

// @invariant read-only: ¬ ∃ call db.*.update (u)

// @invariant page-bounded: ∀ call db.*.findMany (f) => f.take = pageSize
```

**`@ensures`** - a semantic post-condition on the result of an external call. Bridges what TypeScript's type system can't express. Type-level information (field names, types, nullability) is extracted automatically; `@ensures` adds semantic facts like "the returned record matches the query".

```typescript
const fromAccount = await db.account.findUnique({ where: { id: fromId } });
// @ensures fromAccount.id = fromId
// @ensures fromAccount.workspaceId = auth.workspaceId
```

## Full example

**Input:** `rotateApiKey.ts`

```typescript
// @invariant no-secret-leak: ¬ tainted apiKey in call logger.*
async function rotateApiKey(apiKey: string, keyId: string) {
  const newKey = await generateKey();
  await db.apiKey.update({ where: { id: keyId }, data: { key: apiKey } });
  await logger.info("rotated:" + keyId);
}
```

**Output:** `rotateApiKey_jscore.lean` (generated, proved by `native_decide`)

```lean
def rotateApiKey_body : Expr :=
  (.call "generateKey" [] "newKey"
    (.call "db.apiKey.update"
      [("where", (.obj [("id", (.var "keyId"))])),
       ("data", (.obj [("key", (.var "apiKey"))]))]
      "__void_0"
      (.call "logger.info"
        [("arg0", (.binOp .add (.strLit "rotated:") (.var "keyId")))]
        "__void_1" Expr.none)))

theorem rotateApiKey_no_secret_leak
    : notTaintedIn rotateApiKey_body "apiKey" "logger.*" = true := by
  native_decide
```

The taint analysis walks the AST, tracks that `apiKey` flows to `db.apiKey.update` but never reaches any `logger.*` call. `native_decide` reduces the entire check to `true` at compile time.

## What you can prove

Three proof shapes:
- **Taint analysis** (syntactic, `native_decide`): does sensitive data reach a call target?
- **Nonexistence** (syntactic, `native_decide`): does a call pattern appear in the AST?
- **Runtime properties** (inductive proofs over eval): properties about every call's arguments across all execution paths

## Taint precision

```typescript
// secret flows to crypto.hmac (whitelisted), signature is safe, logLine is safe
// @invariant no-secret-in-logs: ¬ tainted secret in call logger.*
async function signAndLog(secret: string, userId: string, action: string) {
  const payload = userId + ":" + action;
  const signature = await crypto.hmac(secret, payload);  // whitelisted
  const logLine = payload + "|sig:" + signature;
  await logger.info(logLine);  // safe: signature not tainted
}

// secret flows to unsafeHash.digest (NOT whitelisted), tag is tainted, leaks
// @invariant secret-leaks-to-logs: tainted secret in call logger.*
async function leakyLog(secret: string, userId: string) {
  const tag = await unsafeHash.digest(secret);  // result stays tainted
  const logLine = userId + ":" + tag;
  await logger.info(logLine);  // leak: tag carries taint
}
```

Both proved by `native_decide`. The analysis tracks taint through binding chains and call results. Whitelisting a callee (`@invariant no-taint: ¬ tainted key in result` on the declaration) marks its output as clean.

## Building

```bash
# Lean formalism
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"
cd jscore && lake build JSCore

# Extract and verify
cd extractor
npx tsx src/index.ts extract --out-dir ../examples ../examples/*.ts

# Verify all proofs
cd examples && lake build
```

Requires: Lean 4 v4.16.0 (via elan), Node.js, TypeScript.

## Architecture

```
jscore/JSCore/          Lean 4 formalism (~2,870 LOC)
  Syntax.lean           26-constructor Expr type (CPS-style calls)
  Values.lean           Val (str/num/bool/none/obj/arr), Env, Store
  Eval.lean             fuel-bounded evaluator, structural recursion
  Trace.lean            CallRecord, callsTo, pattern matching with wildcards
  Taint.lean            syntactic taint analysis, notTaintedIn (decidable)
  Metatheory/           equation lemmas, trace composition, loop invariants, taint soundness
  Tactics.lean          trace_simp, by_taint, by_ordering

extractor/src/          TypeScript extractor (~1,000 LOC)
  ast-to-jscore.ts      ts-morph AST to JsCoreExpr (CPS translation)
  lean-emitter.ts       JsCoreExpr to Lean source text
  lean-theorem.ts       annotations to theorem statements
  proof-merge.ts        proof-preserving regeneration

examples/               annotated TS + generated Lean proofs
  *.ts                  source with @requires/@invariant/@ensures
  *_jscore.lean         extracted defs + proved theorems
```

Re-running the extractor preserves existing proofs. New `def` bodies and theorem statements are regenerated, but non-sorry proof bodies and private helper lemmas are spliced back in.

## How proofs work

The eval function maps `Expr` to `Result` (outcome + store + trace). Proofs step through eval one constructor at a time using equation lemmas (`eval_call_eq`, `eval_letConst_eq`, etc.), then inspect the trace.

For loops, `forOfFold_callsTo` provides a reusable invariant: given a per-iteration property on call records and a store invariant, it proves the property holds across the entire foldl.

For taint, `notTaintedIn` is a Bool function that walks the AST. `taint_soundness` proves: if `notTaintedIn` returns true, changing the tainted source's value does not change any matching call's arguments.

## Limitations

JSCore₀ covers a subset of TypeScript/JavaScript. The extractor handles: `const`/`let`, `if`/`else`, `for...of`, `while`, `await` calls, object/array literals, spread, destructuring, template literals, `try`/`catch`, `throw`, `return`, `break`, `push`, optional chaining, and common array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `find`, `some`, `every`, `flatMap`).

Not supported: closures over mutable state, `this`, dynamic property access (`obj[expr]`), generators, `eval`, `Proxy`, `as any`, classes, `switch`, and most runtime reflection. `Promise.all` is desugared to sequential calls (sound but conservative). Unsupported constructs emit `sorry`, making the proof unprovable, which surfaces as a build failure.

The language fragment is deliberately chosen to cover the patterns that matter most for backend/data-access code: CRUD operations, loops over collections, conditional branching, and external API calls. Most SaaS application code fits this fragment.
